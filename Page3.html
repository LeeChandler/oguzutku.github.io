<p><strong>These days Bill focuses most of his time on the work he and Melinda are doing through their foundation. People are often surprised to hear him say that this work has a lot in common with his work at Microsoft. In both cases, he gets to bring together smart people and collaborate with them to solve big, tough problems. Bill is gratified to know that the foundation and its many partners are helping people all over the world live healthier, more productive lives.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In November 2014, the Gates Foundation announced that they were adopting an open access (OA) policy for publications and data, "to enable the unrestricted access and reuse of all peer-reviewed published research funded by the foundation, including any underlying data sets".This move has been widely applauded by those who are working in the area of capacity building and knowledge sharing.[citation needed] Its terms have been called the most stringent among similar OA policies.As of January 1, 2015 their Open Access policy is effective for all new agreements.In March 2017, it was confirmed that the open access policy, Gates Open Research would be based on the same initiative launched in 2016 by Wellcome Trust in their Wellcome Open Research policy launched in partnership with F1000 Research. </strong></p>
<p><strong> In addition to the foundation&rsquo;s work, Bill has separately taken on some projects to address issues that interest him personally, such as delivering clean energy to everyone who needs it. In all his work&mdash;with the foundation and otherwise&mdash;he&rsquo;s focused on what he calls catalytic philanthropy: investments in innovations that will improve life for the poorest. They&rsquo;re solutions to problems where markets and governments underinvest.</strong></p>
